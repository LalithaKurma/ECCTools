-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
Fierce uses several techniques to identify potential targets for a penetration
assessment. All of the techniques used by Fierce are passive in nature.
Therefore, there should not any negative impact of running Fierce, since the
majority of the techniques include DNS requests and ARIN lookups.

== Enumerate the name-servers ==

When Fierce starts a scan against a domain, it first resolves the domain to an
IP addresses. It then continues to identify the primary, secondary and
additional name-servers. The requests is known as an 'ns' request which stands
for name-servers. Once Fierce identifies the name-servers for the Domain, it will
uses these severs for all DNS requests since these servers may contain
additional information about the domain being targeted. 

Most UNIX systems have a tool called dig which can be used to make 'ns'
requests. For example: 

    dig @ns-server domain.com ns

This will perform an 'ns' request against the server 'ns-server' for
domain.com. This will return all the name-servers for domain.com.

== ARIN ==

One of the new features in Fierce v2.0 is the ARIN module. The way this is used
is that Fierce v2.0 will perform a ARIN lookup of the domain first. The result
of this query contains several net-handles. Each of these are then quarried to
gather more details about the ranges that are owned by the domain being tested.

== Zone Transfer ==

Fierce leverages a classic passive recon technique to identify information from
the name-servers for a given Domain. It will attempt a 'axfr' request against
each name-server. Even if one of the requests is successful, Fierce will
continue to perform the 'axfr' request against all name-servers. Based on our
testing, we have found several customers that have exposed internal RFC 1918 ip
addresses with the zone files. If an attacker is able to query the name-server
and extract this information they are able to determine hosts to target once
they gain internal access. There is usually no business reason for an
organization to have Zone Transfers enabled. Therefore, we highly recommend
that it be disabled for all name-servers. 

Most UNIX systems have a tool called dig which can be used to make 'axfr'
requests. For example: 

    dig @ns-server domain.com axfr

This will perform an 'axfr' request against the server 'ns-server' for
domain.com.

== WildCard ==

The next technique that Fierce uses to identify IP addresses for domain.com is
that it checks for WildCards. Checking for WildCards is an important step,
because if the organization has a WildCard inplace this will effect the
rest of the testing.  For example, some organizations configure there DNS
servers to resolve: ANYTHING-YOU-TYPE.domain.com to a specific DIP
addresses. If this is the case, the penetration tester needs to remember
that any host names that resolve to this IP address are likely due to the
WildCard being inplace and not because the hostname is valid. A good
penetration tester will take this into account when performing Network
Recon, and customize their testing in order to identify additional
targets and prevent false positives.

== Prefix Bruteforce ==

Prefix Bruteforcing is a technique that is used to locate hostnames that
resolve to an IP address. Fierce leverages an advanced version of prefix
bruteforcing, in addition to attempting to resolve common prefixes like (www,
mail and test).domain.com, Fierce will attempt to append digits 1 through 5 to
the end of each prefix to identify if any additional systems are associated
with this prefix. If the prefix or the prefix with a '1' appended to the end
resolves to an IP address, Fierce will attempt 2 through 5. The largest digit
is configurable using:

    ./fierce -dns domain.com -maxbruteforce [int]

== Subdomain Bruteforcing ==

New in Fierce v2.0 is the ability to bruteforce subdomains. Though similar to
prefix bruteforcing, this technique involves testing subdomains for each found
domain.

For example:
    www.mail.yahoo.com 
    www.mail2.yahoo.com
    www.mail3.yahoo.com
    etc...

The method uses a wordlist of subdomains. In addition to the supplied wordlist,
Fierce will also attempt to add an integer to the end of each subdomain.  You
can supply your own wordlist using the "-subdomain [file|URL]" syntax.

== TLD Bruteforcing ==

New in Fierce v2.0 is the ability to bruteforce alternate domain TLDs - that
is, top level domains such as .com, .net or .org. Many organizations will
register all of these domains, and use all them differently for operational
reasons.

Fierce creates a list of TLDs and attempts to resolve the IP address for each
of the resulting hostnames. This technique is not enabled by default, as it is
usually only useful for large international organizations.

This technique also has an interactive interface which allows for domains to be
added to the current scan.

     ./fierce -dns google.com -only tldbf

    TLD Bruteforce:
    (..snip..)

== Virtual Hosts ==

Fierce has the ability to identify alternate hostnames for the IP addresses
that have been found. Fierce does this by querying msn.com using: the
"ip:x.x.x.x" syntax.

This technique can be useful for locating alternate applications or websites
hosted on the same server, which may provide attack surface. This technique
increases the likelihood of inconsistent results and false positives. Fierce
tries to remove Microsoft hostnames from the result. Virtual Host testing is
off by default.

== MX Records ==

Fierce v2.0 enumerates all MX records for a domain. This is done using the
standard DNS query.
    
    dig domain.com MX

== Whois Lookup ==

Fierce v2.0 has the ability to perform a whois lookups. As part of the default
scan, Fierce v2.0 will perform a whois lookup against the IP address of the
domain.

== Hostname Lookups ==

Fierce v2.0 has the ability to perform forward lookups for all the hostnames
that it has identified. It will perform 10 lookups per hostname found durin
prefix bruteforcing. The number of lookups is configurable.

    ./fierce -dns domain.com -maxlookups [int]


== Find Nearby IPs / IP Lookups ==

The last techniques that is used by Fierce v2.0 is to identify systems may be
controlled by the same domain, by performing IP lookups of the addresses within
the class C blocks that have already been found. The best method to improve the
results is to use -wide when performing a scan.

    ./fierce -dns domain.com -wide

Using -wide will make Fierce v2.0 perform lookups for every IP that has
already been found within the Class C network. If the hostname's IP matches the
target domain, it is added to the list of hosts. If the domain does not match,
Fierce will prompt the user to determine whether they would like to enumerate
the new domain.

Example:

    ...snip...
    
    Nearby IPs:
    Would you like to add domains found using Nearby IPs: [Y|N]
    y
    Would you like to scan bar.com ? [Y|N]
    y
    Would you like to scan foo.com ? [Y|N]
    n

    ...snip...

    Once this scan completes, Fierce v2.0 will perform a full scan of bar.com.
